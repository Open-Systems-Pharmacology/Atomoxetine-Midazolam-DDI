# Atomoxetine-Midazolam-DDI
Modeling of published atomoxetine-midazolam-DDI studies for model evaluation

## Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a PK-Sim snapshot containing simulations of all published clinical studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of the atomoxetine and midazolam models regarding atomoxetine-midazolam-DDIs, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. The applied models have been published previously [1,2]. The originally published atomoxetine model [1] was adapted to include competitive inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.

For further details and documentation please refer to [3].
